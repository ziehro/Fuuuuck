# Flutter Launcher Icons Configuration (Top-level)

  ios: false # Set to true when you configure iOS
  image_path: "assets/splash_icon.png" # Use the same icon for your app launcher
  # Optional: For Android 8.0+ adaptive icons, you can specify layers.
  # If you provide both adaptive_icon_background and adaptive_icon_foreground,
  # it will generate adaptive icons. Otherwise, it will use image_path
  # to generate legacy icons that will also work on adaptive launchers.
  # For simplicity, sticking to `image_path` will generate a single image icon
  # that Android will try to fit into adaptive shapes.
  # adaptive_icon_background: "#8B4513" # A solid color background for adaptive icons
